Welcome to BIFX 552
===================

Syllabus
--------

### Course Description

This class provides an introduction to applied data science skills
needed by bioinformatics professionals. A focus will be placed on
reproducible bioinformatics research and will include the following
topics and tools: beginning to intermediate use of the Unix command
line, working with remote computing resources, version tracking, R and
Bioconductor, tools for manipulating sequence data, and creation of
pipelines.

-   Instructor: Randall Johnson, PhD
-   Office Hours: In-person office hours will be held Thursdays
    immediately after class, and online office hours will be held Monday
    evenings from 8:30 to 9:30 PM. During online office hours, the
    Blackboard discussion thread titled "Office Hours" will be
    actively monitored.
-   Prerequisites: BIFX 503
-   Textbook: Bioinformatics Data Skills: Reproducible and Robust
    Research with Open Source Tools 1st Edition, by Vince Buffalo,
    O'Reilly Media (2015)
-   Communications: All course communications will be posted
    on Blackboard. In order to receive timely notifications, it is
    recommended that you do one or more of the following:
    -   Check Blackboard often
    -   Set your Blackboard email notifications to alert you when
        something is posted
    -   Download the phone app and enable push notifications (this may
        not be the best option this term, as the app was just released
        and seems to be a little limited).

### Learning Objectives

On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the
following:

-   Use of the Unix command line to manipulate data and perform
    bioinformatic analysis tasks
-   Logging into and using remote computing resources
-   Working with version controlled code repositories in a collaborative
    work environment
-   Use of R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatic analysis tasks
-   Stitching a series of commands and/or programs together into a
    reusable pipeline

### Homework

In addition to weekly reading assignments, Blackboard modules containing
instructional vignettes will need to be viewed. These modules will be
followed by a short quiz to guage class understanding prior to class.
Students will be given a score for each quiz, but only participation
will be tracked for the purpose of grading (i.e. if you complete both
the module and the quiz, full points will be awarded for grading
purposes).

### Grading

Grades will be based on completion of homework, in-class participation,
and two exams.

-   Homework - 30%
-   In-class participation - 30%
-   Mid-term - 20%
-   Final exam - 20%

### Weather

In the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College
and the cancellation of a regularly scheduled class, the material from
the missed class will be posted on blackboard, and at least two live
chat sessions will be held to work through material and answer
questions.

### Tentative Schedule

Reading assignments are from Buffalo's Bioinformatics Data Skills unless
otherwise specified, and they should be read *prior* to class. More
details on reading assignments will be given on
[Blackboard](https://hood.blackboard.com/).
