# Welcome to BIFX 552

## Sylabus

### Course Description
This class provides an introduction to applied data science skills needed by bioinformatics professionals. A focus will be placed on reproducible bioinformatics research and will include the following topics and tools: beginning to intermediate use of the Unix command line, working with remote computing resources, version tracking, R and Bioconductor, tools for manipulating sequence data, and creation of pipelines.

* Instructor: Randall Johnson, PhD
* Office Hours: In-person office hours will be held Thursdays immediately after class, and online office hours will be held Monday evenings from 8:30 to 9:30 PM. During online office hours, the Blackboard discussion thread titled "Office Hours" will be actively monitored.
* Prerequisites: BIFX 503
* Textbook: Bioinformatics Data Skills: Reproducible and Robust Research with Open Source Tools 1st Edition, by Vince Buffalo, O'Reilly Media (2015)

### Learning Objectives
On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the following:

* Use of the Unix command line to manipulate data and perform bioinformatic analysis tasks
* Logging into and using remote computing resources
* Working with version controlled code repositories in a collaborative work environment
* Use of R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatic analysis tasks
* Stitching a series of commands and/or programs together into a reusable pipeline

### Homework
In addition to weekly reading assignments, Blackboard modules containing instructional vignettes will need to be viewed. These modules will be followed by a short quiz to guage class understanding prior to class. Students will be given a score for each quiz, but only participation will be tracked for the purpose of grading (i.e. if you complete both the module and the quiz, full points will be awarded for grading purposes).

### Grading
Grades will be based on completion of homework, in-class participation, and two exams.

* Homework - 30%
* In-class participation - 30%
* Mid-term - 20%
* Final exam - 20%

### Weather
In the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College and the cancellation of a regularly scheduled class, the material from class will be posted on blackboard, and at least two live chat sessions will be held to answer questions.
