This code of conduct is developed for the Fall 2020 section of [BIFX
552](https://github.com/BIFXapps/BIFX552).

### Hood College aims to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment

Hood College is dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and
harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of:

-   gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
-   intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software
    preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

This code of conduct, as well as the Hood College Code of Conduct and
the Academic Honor Code, applies to all course-related communications,
including but not limited to Blackboard, the BIFX cluster, lectures,
coding demos, group discussion, Teams, other Microsoft products and any
other discussions related to BIFX 552. We do not tolerate harassment,
intimidation, or bullying of students or staff. Sexual language and
imagery are not appropriate in communications or in online venues,
including chats.

Violating these rules will be dealt with according to the procedures
outlined in the [Student
Handbook](https://www.hood.edu/sites/default/files/ResLife/StudentHandbook19-20.pdf).

### Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

-   Making comments in chats, to an audience or personally, that
    belittle or demean another person
-   Sharing sexual images online
-   Harassing photography or recording
-   Sustained disruption of talks or other events
-   Unwelcome sexual attention
-   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

-   Aggressive or browbeating behavior directed at someone during a
    public presentation
-   Mocking or insulting another person’s intellect, work, perspective,
    or question/comment
-   Making reference to someone’s gender, gender identity and
    expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
    body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attributes in the
    context of a scientific discussion
-   Deliberately making someone feel unwelcome

### Social media policy

Images and content from lectures, labs, coding demos and class
discussions may be shared publicly through social media or other public
forums unless the instructor asks for it not to be. Homework and exams
should not be shared or discussed outside of the course forums.

Students should also be aware that live coding demos will be recorded
and posted on Blackboard for asynchronous viewing. All are encouraged to
join live class meetings with their cameras on to foster a more dynamic
learning environment, but anyone who is uncomfortable with this is
welcome to join via audio only.

### Enforcement

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If an individual engages in harassing behavior, the instructor and/or
other staff within the program will work with the offender to remediate
the behavior. This includes warning the offender or possibly taking
other academic actions.

The instructor may take action to redress anything designed to, or with
the clear impact of, disrupting the course or making the environment
hostile for any individuals.

We expect everyone to follow these rules throughout the course and
during all course-related online activities.

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
violations reduce the value of our program for everyone. We want to
foster a safe, enjoyable and productive learning environment. People
like you make our program a better.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous or Non-anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report
[here](https://www.hood.edu/node/9221). We can’t follow up an anonymous
report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take
whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

#### Personal Report

You can make a personal report with Dr Johnson or Dr Darby.

When taking a personal report, we will do our best to maintain your
safety and privacy. We may involve other department staff to ensure your
report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about
what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can include someone to support you.
You won’t be asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you
are. We will do our best to maintain your anonymity when addressing the
incident. In the event that remediation may expose your identity, we
will discuss options with you prior to taking any action.

We will be happy to help you contact campus security, local law
enforcement, local support services, or otherwise assist you to feel
safe for the duration of the course. We value your presence and
contributions to this course.
