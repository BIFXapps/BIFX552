Setup
-----

We will work on these two problems as a class. Copy the *lab15*
directory from my home directory to your home directory.

Bash script
-----------

Write a bash script that downloads argument 1 from the BIFX552 GitHub
repo to the current working directory.

Snakemake
---------

Write a Snakemake file to do the following inside of this directory:

-   Symbolically link the two files specified in the *~/lab15/files* to
    this directory.
-   Give the symbolic links a short name.
-   Create a vcf file for each bam file (you may find this [how
    to](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=2803) helpful).
